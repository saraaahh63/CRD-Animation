   </div>
   <div class="block" id="block1">
      <p class="text" id="text">Chinese restaurants serve a variety of budgets and appetites, from fast-food storefronts
         to palatial banquet halls.China is a large country and its many regional specialties are also represented. </p>
   </div>
   <div class="block" id="block2">
      <p class="text" id="text">New York City alone has 2500 Chinese restaurants, plus countless other Chinese-inspired
         eateries.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="block" id="block3">
      <p class="text" id="text">The history of how Chinese food became favored and Chinese restaurants so numerous is
         filled with surprising twists and turns, as well as unexpected actors.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="block" id="block4">
      <p class="text" id="text">In the 1870s, masses of white men mobilized to halt Chinese immigration.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="block" id="block5">
      <p class="text" id="text">They carried incredible political power. Women could not vote and black men were
         prevented at the ballot box from casting their opinions.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="block" id="block6">
      <p class="text" id="text">Politicians headed their demands, passing what would become the Chinese Exclusion Act of
         1882.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="block" id="block7">
      <p class="text" id="text">It stopped Chinese laborers from coming into the country and those already here from
         naturalizing.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="block" id="block8">
      <p class="text" id="text">There were loopholes, however. Special provisions allowed Chinese businessmen to enter
         and to sponsor the emigration of wives and children. These were known as “merchant exemptions.”</p>
   </div>
   <div class="block" id="block9">
      <p class="text" id="text">For a time Chinese restaurant owners counted as “laborers,” whose immigration
         opportunities had been eliminated by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="block" id="block10">
      <p class="text" id="text">Restaurant owners fought long and hard through the courts to be counted as merchants.
      </p>
   </div>
   <div class="block" id="block11">
      <p class="text" id="text">The fortunes of restaurant owners changed. In 1915, a federal appeals court judge in New
         York finally affirmed that restaurants owners qualified for merchant exemption. This case set a legal precedent
         that prevailed until Chinese Exclusion was repealed.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="block" id="block12">
      <p class="text" id="text">The Chinese Restaurant Database is based on the efforts of the Chinese to live, work,
         and travel while Chinese Exclusion remained in force (1882-1943). Dozens of researchers have scrutinized
         immigration files to present, here and now, the Chinese restaurant industry.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="block" id="block13">
      <p class="text" id="text">Chinese laborers opened restaurants to expand their immigration opportunities.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="block" id="block14">
      <p class="text" id="text">In 1919, the number of restaurants spiked. World War I had just ended and the American
         economy was strong.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="block" id="block15">
      <p class="text" id="text">Most Chinese laborers had come to the United States as young adults. Typically,
         relatives who had exemption statuses sponsored them.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="block" id="block16">
      <p class="text" id="text">Many aspired to go into business for themselves, instead of working for others. Opening
         a restaurant called for more capital than most laborers had. Banks refused them loans.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="block" id="block17">
      <p class="text" id="text">They found a solution--pool resources. They operated restaurants as partnerships.
         Typically, four men invested equally and agreed to run the restaurant together.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="block" id="block18">
      <p class="text" id="text">Often times they needed to fundraise from friends and family. They sold shares, which
         paid these silent investors dividends at the end of the year. Most restaurants had $20,000-$30,000 in starting
         capital, worth nearly half a million today.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="block" id="block19">
      <p class="text" id="text">The restaurant soon paid off for partners wishing to reunite with family in China</p>
   </div>
   <div class="block" id="block20">
      <p class="text" id="text">After a year, one partner was eligible for merchant exemption.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="block" id="block21">
      <p class="text" id="text">In the immigration interview, he told officers about the restaurants. Who his partners
         were. What were his duties. He detailed the finances as well.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="block" id="block22">
      <p class="text" id="text">Witnesses showed up to support his case. The law required two non-Chinese individuals in
         merchant applications. Restaurant owners typically called on vendors for help.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="block" id="block23">
      <p class="text" id="text">With papers in hand, Chinese restaurant owners went to China. They had been away a long
         time. Chinese laborers had to save for many years to become partners in restaurants.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="block" id="block24">
      <p class="text" id="text">They intended to reunite with their family. Many restaurant owners left behind wife and
         children in their hometowns.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="block" id="block25">
      <p class="text" id="text">These were joyous occasions. Everyone in their hometowns celebrated these return visits.
         Chinese restaurant owners often stayed for a year, before returning to the United States.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="block" id="block26">
      <p class="text" id="text">He often returned to with a young son to teach the restaurant business.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="block" id="block27">
      <p class="text" id="text">This is how Chinese immigrants were able to grow their businesses and communities.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="block" id="block28">
      <p class="text" id="text">End.</p>
